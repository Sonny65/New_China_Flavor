As he was stopped by a Chinese guard, the lieutenant attempted to drive past the gate. The guard stopped him again and Oyama shot and killed the guard. Other Chinese guards returned fire and Lieutenant Oyama was killed in the shootout. The incident heightened the tensions between the Chinese and Japanese forces in Shanghai. In response to the incident, the Japanese began sending in reinforcements to Shanghai. A second front in Shanghai and total war between Japan and Shanghai seems inevitable."
